# AOSpine-ExternalValidation

This repository contains the code and resources used in the project funded by the AO Spine Discovery & Innovation Award (AOS-DIA-22-012-TUM). Our research focused on the external validation of all current prediction models that predict survival for patients with spinal metastatic disease.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to rigorously assess the accuracy and reliability of existing predictive models in forecasting survival outcomes for patients with spinal metastatic disease. This work is crucial for improving clinical decision-making and patient care strategies.
